# Vertex Anim Toolset
Unreal Engine tools for baking Skeletal Mesh animation into textures to animate meshes through the material shader

ATTENTION! Epic made a plugin called AnimToTexture for the City Sample of UE 5 which does a lot of the same things as this plugin. You should use that instead if you are using UE 5 and up versions. You can find more info about the AnimToTexture plugin at minute 8:48 of this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_dJtk3BCyg).
